# Project_K
Project K. Interesting name, isn't it? 
In short, I study at a place called Quantorium, and there we developed the idea and structure of the project. 
The essence of the project is as follows, with the help of it a person can make an appointment with a doctor without visiting the reception. 
I am responsible for the server, and Dima Drozdov is responsible for the appearance of the site.
